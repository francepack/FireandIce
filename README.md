## Ice and Fire Redux Challenge
This was an in-school test of our knowledge of react/redux. Without refering to lessons or previous projects, we were tasked with spinning up a simple react/redux app.
The main requirements were as follows:
*Conceptualizing components/containers
*Setting up actions, reducers, and redux store
*Testing actions, reducers, mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps
