## Ice and Fire Redux Challenge
This was an in-school test of our knowledge of react/redux. Without refering to lessons or previous projects, we were tasked to spin up a simple react/redux app in 3 hours.

The main requirements were as follows:
* Conceptualizing components/containers
* Making a fetch call to retrieve data
* Use react principals to display data in proper components
* Setting up actions, reducers, and redux store
* Testing actions, reducers, mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps

Much of the css was built in to the boiler-plate we started with, but I did want to include an image of the finished project to give an idea of what this challenge entailed:
